“Dear Admissions Committee Director’s Name:

It is a true pleasure for me to write this letter of recommendation for [Student Name], who was my student in Sociology 115, “Introduction to Sociology,” in the winter term of XXXX. [Student Name] is, without question, one of the four or five most outstanding students I have taught at Big State University in my six years of teaching.

[Student Name] is a careful and creative thinker with an eye for detail and a devotion to logic, which serves her well both in the sciences and outside of them. She has the terrific ability to draw on her own experience and observations to develop thoughtful opinions on a variety of issues. [Student Name] already knew she wanted to major in biology when she took my course, but this did not diminish her intellectual curiosity about the topics we covered in Introductory Sociology. Her regular contributions to full-class discussions provided insight both for her peers and for me as an instructor. 

[Student Name] was also invaluable in small-group interaction with her peers. Without my asking, she took on the responsibility of helping her classmates consolidate vast amounts of information into coherent sets of ideas, and she quickly became a study group leader. In addition, [Student Name] was very generous with her time and energy. I remember her meeting individually with a student from Thailand several times before the final exam to help him master all the material in a foreign language. 

[Student Name] breaks the “scientist” stereotype with her writing: she was the best writer in the two sections I taught that semester. What was perhaps even more impressive was that she took the task of improving her writing more seriously than any other student in the class. One of her essays was later published in the annual sociology magazine “Title of Magazine.”

[Student Name] is not only an excellent student, but she is also personally delightful. She is as comfortable with herself as she is engaging, pleasant, and humorous. As I got to know [Student Name] over the semester, I became only more impressed by the wide range of her abilities—and by her modesty about them. She is an accomplished musician and scientist, both of which she does with a passion rare in undergraduates. 

I wholeheartedly recommend [Student Name] as a prospective medical school student. In fact, I can think of few students whom I would recommend as highly. She will add a great deal to any incoming medical school class. I can also envision [Student Name] as a highly competent and caring physician someday, which I say as a high compliment indeed. Please contact me if there is anything else I can do on [Student Name’s] behalf.

Sincerely,

Professor Name / Signature”

Dear Mr. Manzie,

My name is Professor Max Marvlin, and I'm writing to you to recommend Caroline Woe for the position of assistant project manager. I served as Ms. Woe's academic advisor and professor during her time at Northridge University, where she studied business management. I had the pleasure of knowing Ms. Woe for three years and teaching her in two of my courses. She would make a wonderful assistant project manager because she works hard to meet her goals.

Ms. Woe excels in time management, self-motivation and problem-solving. In my time as her professor, she never missed an assignment and was careful to monitor all of her deadlines closely. Each assignment she turned in displayed the utmost effort and attention to detail. Ms. Woe also took it upon herself to help her classmates and establish study groups for all examinations.

Throughout her academic career, Ms. Woe worked tirelessly to achieve her goals and overcome challenges. She transferred to Northridge during the second year of her undergraduate career and actively sought ways to ensure she reached her desired graduation date. She met with me and other advisors to determine a realistic yet ambitious schedule to maintain her credit requirements and meet her goals.

I can attest that Ms. Woe would be an asset to your team and is eager for the opportunity to learn from your position. She brings her positive attitude and results-oriented resolve to everything she does. Ms. Woe can provide a high level of knowledge and a resilient work ethic that would greatly benefit your operations.

Sincerely,

Professor Max Malvin
